spheretrace
-----------

This mini-project has the explicit goal to be my first raytracer. With such a stated goal, it will almost invariably *suck*.

It traces spheres, that's the only geometric primitive supported. But boy does it trace them, fast, hard and accurate. It might be one of the most accurate sphere renderers in existance (doubt it).

Right now it traces a sphere, lambert shades it blue and puts some mirror balls around it. It also got one of the most horrible anti-aliasing filters in existence.
